about=Manage your playoffs! Just list the names of the participating teams and generate the matches easily. Championships with number of subscriptions not contained in the sequence (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) will have pre-classified teams in the first stage. With the progress of the matches, type their correspondent scores to proceed with the next phases. You can also check your current championships and those already finalized on the menu above.
